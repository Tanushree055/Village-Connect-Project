        <div style="position: absolute;top: 45%" class="text2">Our Story</div>
        <div style="position: absolute;top: 51%;" class="text3">As someone who
            grew up in a village, I have firsthand experience with the
            challenges and situations that villagers face daily. This project
            was born out of a deep desire to improve the quality of life for my
            community and beyond.</div>

        <div style="position: absolute;top: 63%" class="text2">Our Mission</div>
        <div style="position: absolute;top: 69%;" class="text3">Our mission is
            to empower village residents by providing comprehensive information
            and efficient solutions to common village issues. We strive to
            bridge the gap between rural and urban areas, fostering better
            communication and collaboration.</div>
        <div style="position: absolute;top: 81%" class="text2">Our Vision</div>
        <div style="position: absolute;top: 87%;" class="text3">We envision a
            connected and informed village community where residents have easy
            access to information and resources, and where their voices are
            heard by authorities, leading to timely and effective problem
            resolution.</div>

                <div style="font-size:30px" class="text2">The Inspiration</div>
                <div class="text3">The idea for this project came from my own
                    experiences and observations. In my village, government
                    officials often neglect daily issues such as water scarcity,
                    garbage disposal, mosquito infestations, unhealthy living
                    conditions, and the lack of educational facilities.<br>Village
                    panchayat members sometimes prioritize their own financial
                    gain over the needs of the community. Witnessing these
                    issues firsthand inspired me to create a solution that would
                    address these problems directly and effectively.</div>
